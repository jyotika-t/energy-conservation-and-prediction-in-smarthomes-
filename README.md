#Smart Home Energy Conservation and Prediction
Project Overview
This project builds a Smart Home Visual Dashboard that monitors and predicts energy consumption patterns within a smart home environment. By leveraging sensor data from various rooms, the system tracks movement sequences, analyzes room visit counts, and forecasts energy usage. The goal is to optimize energy conservation while maintaining occupant comfort.

Features
Movement Sequence Tracking: Captures and visualizes the sequence of movements of occupants through different rooms using sensor IDs.
Visit Count Monitoring: Tracks and displays the frequency of visits to each room in the home.
Energy Consumption Prediction: Predicts future energy usage based on occupant movement and historical energy consumption.
Interactive Visual Dashboard: Utilizes Plotly to provide clear and interactive graphs and heat maps for easy data exploration.
Energy Optimization Recommendations: Helps identify opportunities to reduce unnecessary energy usage based on usage patterns.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
ipywidgets (for interactive UI elements in Jupyter)

bash
pip install ipywidgets plotly pandas
